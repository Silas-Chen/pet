# Pet Health Symptoms Dataset
<img src="https://cdn-uploads.huggingface.co/production/uploads/67d2db58176fdb283211e929/hSpURaPA911PH-qUqPjn2.jpeg" alt="Silhouettes of vet and pets, overlapping circles with health issue symbols" width="300">

## Overview
This dataset contains 2,000 LLM-generated pet health symptoms text samples covering 5 common pet health condition categories, designed to train ML models for automated pet health classification. Each entry is labeled with: 
- Pet health condition (1 of 5 distinct classes)  
- Record type (Owner Observation or Clinical Notes)  

Owner observations are expressed in everyday language (e.g., "My cat scratches constantly"), whereas clinical notes contain veterinary terminology (e.g., "Pruritus with alopecia").

## Features
- `text`: One concise sentence describing the pet health symptoms
- `condition`: Skin Irritations, Digestive Issues, Parasites, Ear Infections, Mobility Problems
- `record_type`: Owner Observation, Clinical Notes

## Classification Types
- Binary Classification (`record_type`)
- Multi-class Classification (`condition`)
- Multi-task Classification (`condition` and `record_type`)

## Potential Use Cases
- Pet health chatbots for owners to assess symptoms  
- Automated triage systems for veterinary clinics  
- Educational tools for vet student training  
- Insurance claim processing for analyzing unstructured pet health records
- EHR integration (structuring historical clinical notes)  

## Limitations
- Synthetic data: Simulated but not real clinical records  
- Limited scope: Covers only 5 common conditions  
- Species bias: Primarily cats/dogs (few exotic pet examples)  
- Language simplicity: Lacks complex medical edge cases  
- Demographic gaps: No age/breed metadata for analysis  

## Provenance
- Synthetic data generated by *Gemini 2.5 Pro Experimental*, with prompts stating output format, condition classes, record_type classes, number of samples required, and "maximize your creativity, generate unique data, avoid duplicate data"
- Logo image generated by *Mistral AI Le Chat (Black Forest Labs Flux Ultra)* with the prompt "Silhouettes of vet and pets, overlapping circles with health issue symbols."
